# 🎓 Student Grade Tracker (Java GUI)

This is a simple Java GUI app where you can enter student names and marks to track their performance.  
I built this project as part of **CodeAlpha Internship – Java Development, Task 1**.

## 📌 Project Overview
With the **Student Grade Tracker**, you can:

- 👤 Enter student names and their marks
- 📋 See all student records in a table
- 📊 Get a summary that shows:
  - 🔢 Average marks
  - 🏆 Highest marks
  - 🧮 Lowest marks

This project uses **Java Swing** for the GUI and shows basic concepts like **OOP**, **data handling**, and working with user input.
## 🚀 Features

- ✍️ Input fields to enter student name and marks
- 📄 Table to display all added students in real-time
- 📈 "Show Summary" button to display:
  - Average, highest, and lowest marks
- 🛑 Validates input (e.g., marks must be numbers)
- 💻 Clean, simple, and user-friendly interface
